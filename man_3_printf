.TH _PRINTF 3 "November 2024" "1.0" "Custom Printf Function"
.SH NAME
_printf \- custom formatted output conversion

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdarg.h>
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf
is a custom implementation of the standard printf function. It produces output according to a format as described below. The function writes its output to stdout.

.PP
The
.I format
string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (except %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier. The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.I format
The format string containing the text to be written to stdout. It can include format specifiers that will be replaced by the values of additional arguments.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH EXAMPLES
.B Example usage:
.nf
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
    return 0;
}
.fi
